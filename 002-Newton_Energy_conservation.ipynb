    "Consider the Newton equation for a particle with one degree of freedom in the form of: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\ddot x = F(x) = -\\frac{dU(x)}{dx} = - U'(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  $F(x)$ is the force acting on the particle and  $U(x)$ defined by the relation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = -U'(x)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "is called potential energy (we will write shortly - potential). If we know the force  $F(x)$, then the potential can be found by calculating the integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(x) = - \\int_a^{\\,x}  F(y) dy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is any number  which does not influence dynamics of the system. For example, we can choose so that at some point the potential is zero or infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton equation is a second-order differential. We will re-write it in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot x = v, \\quad \\quad x(0)=x_0$$ $$m\\dot v = F(x) = -U'(x),  \\quad \\quad v(0)=v_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a set of 2 autonomous differential equations of first order. It means that the phase space $\\{x, v\\}$ is 2-dimensional.  In this phase space (which is a plane) we can analyze phase curves: $\\{x(t), v(t)\\}$ as a parametric curves with the parameter being time $t$ and the coordinate $x(t)$ and the velocity $v(t)$  change over time according to the Newton equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem: \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a function (combination) of  $x(t)$  and $v(t)$ that does not change over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = E[x(t), v(t)] = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2(t) + U(x(t)) =  \\frac{1}{2} m v^2(0) + U(x(0)) = E[x(0), v(0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $E$ is called in physics the total energy of the system. \n",
    "It  consists of two parts: the kinetic energy of the particle: $E_k=mv^2/2$ and the potential energy of the particle: $E_p = U(x)$. The total ebergy is determined by initial conditions for the coordinate $x(0$ and  velocity $v(0)$ which are in the expression $E[x(0), v(0)]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof: \n",
    "\n",
    "If $E$ does not change in time, it means that it is a constant function with respect to time and the derivative with respect to time should be zero. Indeed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}  E[x(t), v(t)] = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x}  \\, \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial v}  \\, \\frac{dv}{dt} =  U'(x)  \\, \\dot x +  mv \\, \\dot v = -F(x) v + v F(x), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we used the relationship between the force and the potential energy as well as we exploited  the Newton equation of motion.\n",
    "Because $E$ does not change in time, we say that it is a constant of motion or the  integral of motion, or the first integral of the system (the two last names seem to be bizarre, because in the expression for $E$ no integral is visible). The existence of constants or integrals of the movement facilitates the analysis of systems. \n",

    "\n",
    "The equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(x) = E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is fulfilled when the velocity $v=v(t)$ of the particle is zero. It determines the interval of possible positions $x=x(t)$ of the particle. \n",
    "The curve on the plane is symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis $x$. It follows from the relation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = \\pm \\frac{2}{m} \\sqrt{E-U(x)}$$\n",
